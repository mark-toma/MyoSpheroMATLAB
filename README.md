# Myo Sphero MATLAB
Applications for Myo and Sphero using MATLAB

Using MyoMex and SpheroMATLAB in a MATLAB m-code environment, we explore various applications using one or two Myos and a Sphero device.

Some things that are planned for development include upper limb motion capture using two Myos and a Sphero) and some teleoperation of Sphero using Myo as an input device.
